A Day in the Life of a Superhero


Once upon a time a superhero woke up. She was tired of fixing all mess made by the humans. So she stayed at home, watched TV, and ate ice cream.

Spiderman did nothing as the script write knows nothing about superheroes.

Once upon a bat-time, Batman bat-punched a bat-innocent bat-civilian whilst bat-chasing the Joker.
