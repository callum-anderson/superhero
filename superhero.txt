A bat-Day in the bat-Life of a bat-Superhero


Once upon a bat-time a bat-superhero bat-woke up. She was bat-tired of bat-fixing all the bat-mess bat-made by bat-humans. So she bat-stayed at bat-home, bat-watched bat-TV, and bat-ate bat-ice-cream.

Then suddenly a bat-goldfish accidentally a whole 93mb of bat-files!

Bat-Spiderman did bat-nothing as the bat-script bat-writer bat-knows bat-nothing about bat-superheroes.

Once upon a bat-time, Batman bat-punched a bat-innocent bat-civilian whilst bat-chasing the Joker.
